# Mathematics for Materials Modelling

Welcome to the github page of the [MatMat group](https://matmat.org).
Here you can find the software developed by our group,
often in collaboration with friends from all over the world.

Beyond the repositories shown below, we frequently contribute to the following projects:
- [DFTK.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/):
  Flexible density-functional theory code for multidisciplinary research.
- [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) and its ecosystem
  of packages for manipulating, writing, reading, visualising atomistic structures.
