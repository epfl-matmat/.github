# Mathematics for Materials Modelling

Welcome to the github page of the [MatMat group](https://matmat.org).
Here you can find the software developed by our group,
often in collaboration with friends from all over the world.

Beyond the repositories shown below,
we take a leading role in the development of the following projects:
- [DFTK.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/DFTK.jl/):
  Flexible density-functional theory code for multidisciplinary research.
- The [Juliamolsim](https://juliamolsim.org) ecosystem
  of Julia packages for manipulating, writing, reading, visualising
  atomistic structures,
  such as
  [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl),
  [AtomsCalculators.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsCalculators.jl),
  [AtomsIO.jl](https://github.com/mfherbst/AtomsIO.jl)
  or
  [GeometryOptimization.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/GeometryOptimization.jl/).
- [AiidaDFTK.jl](https://github.com/epfl-matmat/AiidaDFTK.jl)
  and [aiida-dftk](https://github.com/aiidaplugins/aiida-dftk):
  Integration of [DFTK](https://dftk.org) with the [Aiida](https://aiida.net/)
  high-throughput simulation framework.
- [ReducedBasis.jl](https://github.com/mfherbst/ReducedBasis.jl):
  Reduced basis methods for parametrised eigenvalue problems
  (such as the ones occurring in modelling quantum spin systems)
